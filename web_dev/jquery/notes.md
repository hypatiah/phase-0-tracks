#JQUERY STUDY PLAN

*12:15* 20 min: read https://learn.jquery.com/
*12:35* 10 min break
*12:45* 20 min: code academy jquery test skills
*1:05* 10 min break
*1:15* 20 min: https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery
*10 min* break
*30 min* whichever resource was most informative of above, or explore others

I decided to check out three platforms that teach jquery to beginners to see which one was a better learning style for me and also to see the same concepts explained in different ways. 

Notes after: 
I liked checking out multiple resources, and I was surprised that I learned the most from the first resource learn.jquery.com which didn't have animated videos or anything fancy, but emphasized creating an html doc and following along the way. I think in the future it may be better to have breaks of different lengths, ex: few 5 min breaks and one 20 min break, and also to allocate more time to delve deeper into one resource instead of jumping from one to the next so quickly. Also realized it is very easy to dive into one specific function and lose track of time!
