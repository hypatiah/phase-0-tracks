# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    Version control is a tool to view the history of your code, and by history meaning one can edit, revert, track progress, merge revisions by multiple people and make backups of your code. It is useful because with VC you can keep track of how you have changed your code, test out new approaches, review changes, and collaborate with other coders all without losing your original code.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    A branch is a copy of your code. You would create a branch if you want to make a change to your code and want to be sure your original code (or master branch) is preserved in case you mess anything up/or want to have it reviewed by someone else before making a change to your master. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    A commit is a change to any file in your code that is then stored as a save point and can be accessed later if needed. A good commit message is one that is detailed and describes the change you made since the last commit. Typically the format is to summarize the commit on the first line in 50 characters or less, leave a blank line, and then a detailed explanaition of what was changed since the last commit.
* What is a merge conflict?
    A merge conflict is when Git cannot automatically merge two branches of code so the coder has to step in and resolve the conflict. In other words, when two branches being integrated into one branch have conflicting messages, and Git isn't able to integrate the changes without the users input.
